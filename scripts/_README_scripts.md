## Scripts used in the analysis of ***Macroecological variation in movement profiles: body mass does not explain it all***

#### in alphabetical order:

class_for_sp.R - script that uses the taxize package to pull each class and order for vertebrates in our species list

datelife_tree.R - script that uses our list of classes to build a basic phylogeny, saved as an .rds file

model_figures.R - script that generates panels of Figure 5 in our manuscript using the saved .rds files generated by our hierarchical models

mods_master.R - script that runs all the hierarchical analyses for our manuscript, output files in .rds format

model_posterior_draws.R - script that generates supplemental Figure 4

MovementProfiles_analysis_master.R - script that run our cleaning steps, covariance analysis, and generates Figures 2 and 4

MovementProfiles_brms_posterior_means.R - script that generates supplemental figures 5-7
